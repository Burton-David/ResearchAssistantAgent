cite,,,,Recent advances in transformer architectures have revolutionized natural language processing. The self-attention mechanism allows models to capture long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional RNNs.
cite,,,,CRISPR-Cas9 systems have shown promising results in treating genetic disorders. Clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy in treating sickle cell disease.

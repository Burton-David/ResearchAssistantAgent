- Relevance analysis with specific reasons:
  - Exact matches
  - Semantic similarity
  - Methodology alignment
  - Supporting/contradicting evidence
- Quality assessment breakdown
- Confidence scoring
- Visual explanations with Rich formatting

### 7. **Batch Processing** (`batch_processor.py`)
- Process multiple queries/documents efficiently
- Support for JSON and CSV input formats
- Parallel job processing
- Comprehensive reporting
- Export results in multiple formats
- Progress tracking and error handling

### 8. **PubMed Integration** (`pubmed_collector.py`)
